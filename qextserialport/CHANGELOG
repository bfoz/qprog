Made all copy constructors and operators private
POSIX:
	Added int fd to store the file descriptor
	Dropped usage of QFile::handle() in favor of fd
	Change Posix_File from QFile* to QFile
	flush() now calls tcflush() instead of QFile::flush()
	Removed getChar(): derived classes should not override non-virtual members of base classes
	Removed putChar(): derived classes should not override non-virtual members of base classes
	Removed ungetChar(): derived classes should not override non-virtual members of base classes
	Removed readLine(): derived classes should not override non-virtual members of base classes
	readData() calls read(2) instead of QFile::read() (the former works, the latter doesn't)
	open() now saves the old termios struct for restoration on close()
	close() now restores the saved termios struct
	open() now uses cfmakeraw(3) for more portable configuration
